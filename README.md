# MATH 6600: Methods of Applied Mathematics

This is the main repository of course materials for MATH 6600 at RPI, Fall 2024. The syllabus is posted in the README below. Lecture notes, homework, exams, and supplementary materials will be posted here or linked through Piazza and Gradescope (RCS access only).

> **Course description (from [RPI Catalog](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=11&coid=18982))**
>
> _Linear vector spaces; eigenvalues and eigenvectors in discrete systems; eigenvalues and eigenvectors in continuous systems including Sturm-Liouville theory, orthogonal expansions and Fourier series, Green’s functions; elementary theory of nonlinear ODEs including phase plane, stability and bifurcation; calculus of variations. Applications will be drawn from equilibrium and dynamic phenomena in science and engineering._
>
> Prerequisites: differential equations ([MATH 2400](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=10&coid=17197)) and advanced calculus ([MATH 4600](https://catalog.rpi.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=24&coid=52217)).


## Syllabus

**Lectures**: Monday/Thursday 10–11:50am in Carnegie 206.

**Instructor**: Andrew Horning

**Office Hours:** Monday and Thursday, 12:30-1:30pm in Amos Eaton 329. 

(Due to holiday, office hours will take place Tuesday 09/03 and not Monday 09/02.) 

**Contact:** hornia3@rpi.edu

**Course Tools:** Communicate (announcements, questions, and discussion) through [Piazza](https://piazza.com/). View and submit homework assignments on [Gradescope](https://www.gradescope.com/). The mid-term will be in-class and the final project will be submitted on Gradescope.

**Grading:** 50% homework, 25% mid-term (TBD), 25% final project (TBD). Problem sets must be submitted to Gradescope before the deadline on the due date. Regrade requests can be made on Gradescope within one week of the due date.

**Collaboration and Academic Integrity:** To maximize your learning objectives, reserve time to work on each problem independently before discussing it with your classmates. Always write up the solution on your own and acknowledge your collaborators. Copying solutions directly from peers, books, internet sources, or AI tools is strictly prohibited.

**Accomodations and Disability Services:** If you have approved accommodations through the Office of Disability Services for Students ([DSS](https://studenthealth.rpi.edu/list-services/disability-student-services)), please reach out to meet with me early in the semester. We are committed to equal access for all students and will be happy to facilitate the use of approved accommodations.
